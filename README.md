# AI Assistant Platform

A modular Agentic AI platform built with Streamlit, demonstrating practical LLM workflows such as tool-augmented agents, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), vector search, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration.

---

## Overview

This project showcases how to build **intelligent AI assistants** using LangChain and LangGraph.
It focuses on real-world patterns including document-based question answering, external tool usage, and structured prompt engineering.

The platform is designed as a hands-on reference for developers exploring modern Agentic AI systems.
